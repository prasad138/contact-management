Frontend (React + MUI)

Contact Form Purpose:
Allows users to input new contact details. Ensures that data like name, email, and phone are collected correctly. Key Features:

Fields: First Name, Last Name, Email, Phone, Company, Job Title. Validation: Ensures that no field is left empty. Design: Material UI (MUI) components for a professional and responsive UI. Submission: Sends the entered data to the backend API via a POST request. Code Highlights:

useState manages form state for controlled inputs. Form submission calls the fetchContacts() function to update the contacts table dynamically without refreshing the page. 2. Contact Table Purpose:

Displays a list of all contacts retrieved from the backend. Provides sorting, pagination, and action buttons for each contact. Key Features:

Sorting: Users can sort contacts based on fields (e.g., name, company). Pagination: Limits the number of contacts displayed on a single page for large datasets. Actions: Includes Edit and Delete buttons for each row. Code Highlights:

MUI's Table and TablePagination components ensure the table is interactive and responsive. handleDelete() triggers an API call to remove a contact and updates the table view. 3. App Component Purpose:

Acts as the main controller for the frontend. Fetches contact data, renders the form and table components, and manages state for the application. Key Features:

Integrates the ContactForm and ContactTable components. Handles API interactions via Axios for GET, POST, and DELETE requests. Centralizes data fetching (fetchContacts()) to ensure the UI updates dynamically. Backend (Node.js + Express)

API Design Endpoints:
POST /contacts

Accepts a JSON object from the frontend to add a new contact. Validates required fields (e.g., First Name, Email). Handles duplicate entries by checking email/phone uniqueness. GET /contacts

Retrieves all contact entries from the database. Returns a JSON array to populate the frontend table. PUT /contacts/

Updates contact details for a given ID. Ensures that the new data is valid before saving changes. DELETE /contacts/

Deletes a contact from the database by ID. Returns a success status if the operation is completed. Error Handling:

Ensures meaningful error messages for validation failures or server issues. For instance, a duplicate email might return a 400 Bad Request with an appropriate message. 2. Database Integration Database Used: MongoDB

Why MongoDB?

Schema flexibility: MongoDB allows JSON-like documents, making it easy to manage the dynamic nature of contact information. Scalability: Well-suited for growing datasets with minimal schema changes. Quick development: Integration with Mongoose simplifies data modeling. Schema Design:

javascript Copy code const contactSchema = new mongoose.Schema({ firstName: { type: String, required: true }, lastName: { type: String, required: true }, email: { type: String, required: true, unique: true }, phone: { type: String, required: true }, company: String, jobTitle: String, }); Mongoose Benefits:

Automatically enforces the schema at the application level. Simplifies CRUD operations with built-in methods like find(), save(), and findByIdAndUpdate(). Workflow Description Adding a Contact:

User fills out the contact form and submits it. The frontend sends a POST request to /contacts. Backend validates the input, saves the new contact in the database, and returns success. Frontend updates the contact table dynamically. Viewing Contacts:

On page load, the frontend sends a GET request to /contacts. Backend retrieves all contacts and sends them to the frontend. Contacts are displayed in the table with pagination and sorting. Editing a Contact:

User clicks the Edit button for a contact, opening a pre-filled form. After editing, the updated data is sent via a PUT request to /contacts/:id. Backend updates the database and returns the updated contact. Frontend refreshes the table to show the updated data. Deleting a Contact:

User clicks the Delete button for a contact. The frontend sends a DELETE request to /contacts/:id. Backend removes the contact and returns success. Frontend refreshes the table to remove the deleted contact. Challenges and Solutions Pagination and Sorting:

Challenge: Implementing these features in both the frontend and backend for large datasets. Solution: MUI’s TablePagination handles the frontend, while MongoDB’s skip() and limit() methods manage backend pagination. Validation:

Challenge: Ensuring valid email, phone, and required fields at both frontend and backend. Solution: Use frontend libraries like Yup for real-time validation and backend checks for server-side security. Concurrency Issues:

Challenge: Handling simultaneous updates/deletions on the same contact. Solution: Use unique identifiers (MongoDB’s _id) and ensure atomicity in operations. Error Handling:

Challenge: Communicating clear errors to the user (e.g., "Email already exists"). Solution: Standardized error messages and frontend feedback. How to Run Frontend Setup: Navigate to the project folder: cd contact-management. Install dependencies: npm install. Start the development server: npm start. Backend Setup: Navigate to the backend folder: cd backend. Install dependencies: npm install. Start MongoDB locally or connect to a cloud instance. Run the server: node server.js.
